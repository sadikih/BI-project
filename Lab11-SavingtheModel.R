# **[OPTIONAL] Initialization: Install and use renv ----
# The R Environment ("renv") package helps you create reproducible environments
# for your R projects. This is helpful when working in teams because it makes
# your R projects more isolated, portable and reproducible.

# Further reading:
#   Summary: https://rstudio.github.io/renv/
#   More detailed article: https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html

# "renv" It can be installed as follows:
# if (!is.element("renv", installed.packages()[, 1])) {
# install.packages("renv", dependencies = TRUE,
# repos = "https://cloud.r-project.org") # nolint
# }
# require("renv") # nolint

# Once installed, you can then use renv::init() to initialize renv in a new
# project.

# The prompt received after executing renv::init() is as shown below:
# This project already has a lockfile. What would you like to do?

# 1: Restore the project from the lockfile.
# 2: Discard the lockfile and re-initialize the project.
# 3: Activate the project without snapshotting or installing any packages.
# 4: Abort project initialization.

# Select option 1 to restore the project from the lockfile
# renv::init() # nolint

# This will set up a project library, containing all the packages you are
# currently using. The packages (and all the metadata needed to reinstall
# them) are recorded into a lockfile, renv.lock, and a .Rprofile ensures that
# the library is used every time you open the project.

# Consider a library as the location where packages are stored.
# Execute the following command to list all the libraries available in your
# computer:
.libPaths()

# One of the libraries should be a folder inside the project if you are using
# renv

# Then execute the following command to see which packages are available in
# each library:
lapply(.libPaths(), list.files)

# This can also be configured using the RStudio GUI when you click the project
# file, e.g., "BBT4206-R.Rproj" in the case of this project. Then
# navigate to the "Environments" tab and select "Use renv with this project".

# As you continue to work on your project, you can install and upgrade
# packages, using either:
# install.packages() and update.packages or
# renv::install() and renv::update()

# You can also clean up a project by removing unused packages using the
# following command: renv::clean()

# After you have confirmed that your code works as expected, use
# renv::snapshot(), AT THE END, to record the packages and their
# sources in the lockfile.

# Later, if you need to share your code with someone else or run your code on
# a new machine, your collaborator (or you) can call renv::restore() to
# reinstall the specific package versions recorded in the lockfile.

# [OPTIONAL]
# Execute the following code to reinstall the specific package versions
# recorded in the lockfile (restart R after executing the command):
# renv::restore() # nolint

# [OPTIONAL]
# If you get several errors setting up renv and you prefer not to use it, then
# you can deactivate it using the following command (restart R after executing
# the command):
# renv::deactivate() # nolint

# If renv::restore() did not install the "languageserver" package (required to
# use R for VS Code), then it can be installed manually as follows (restart R
# after executing the command):

if (require("languageserver")) {
  require("languageserver")
} else {
  install.packages("languageserver", dependencies = TRUE,
                   repos = "https://cloud.r-project.org")
}

# Introduction ----
# What do you do after you have designed a model that is accurate enough to use?
# This is a critical question whose answer enables the gap between research and
# practice to be addressed.

# It is possible to discover the key internal representation of a model found
# by an algorithm (e.g., the coefficients in a linear model) and use
# them in a new implementation of the prediction algorithm in another
# program developed using a programming language other than R.

# This is easier to do for simpler algorithms that use a simple representation,
# e.g., a linear model, than for algorithms that use more complex
# representations.

# "caret" provides access to "the best" model from a training run in the
# "finalModel" variable.
# The "predict()" function in the "caret" package automatically uses the
# "finalModel" to make predictions on a new dataset. The data provided as the
# "new dataset" can be stored in a separate file and loaded as a data frame.

# STEP 1. Install and Load the Required Packages ----
## caret ----
if (require("caret")) {
  require("caret")
} else {
  install.packages("caret", dependencies = TRUE,
                   repos = "https://cloud.r-project.org")
}

## mlbench ----
if (require("mlbench")) {
  require("mlbench")
} else {
  install.packages("mlbench", dependencies = TRUE,
                   repos = "https://cloud.r-project.org")
}

## plumber ----
if (require("plumber")) {
  require("plumber")
} else {
  install.packages("plumber", dependencies = TRUE,
                   repos = "https://cloud.r-project.org")
}

# STEP 2. Load the Dataset ----
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
hospital_dataset <- read_csv(
  "data/dataset.csv",
  col_types = cols(
    Disease = col_factor(
      levels = c(
        "Disease",
        "Hyperthyroidism", # nolint
        "Hypoglycemia",
        "Osteoarthristis",
        "Arthritis",
        "(vertigo) Paroymsal  Positional Vertigo",

        "Chronic cholestasis",
        "Drug Reaction",
        "Peptic ulcer diseae",  
        "AIDS",
        "Diabetes" ,
        "Gastroenteritis",
        "Hypertension",
        "Migraine",
        "Cervical spondylosis",
        "Paralysis (brain hemorrhage)",

        "Hepatitis C",
        "Hepatitis D",
        "Hepatitis E",
        "Alcoholic hepatitis",
        "Tuberculosis",
        "Common Cold",
        "Pneumonia",
        "Dimorphic hemmorhoids(piles)",
        "Heart attack",
        "Varicose veins",
        "Hypothyroidism",
        "Hypoglycemia",
        "Osteoarthristis",
        "Arthritis",
        "Urinary tract infection",
        "Psoriasis",

        "Dimorphic hemmorhoids(piles)",
        "Heart attack"
      )
    ),
    
  )
)

# STEP 3. Train the Model ----
# create an 80%/20% data split for training and testing datasets respectively
set.seed(9)
train_index <- createDataPartition(hospital_dataset$Disease,
                                   p = 0.80, list = FALSE)
Disease_training <- hospital_dataset[train_index, ]
Disease_testing <- hospital_dataset[-train_index, ]

set.seed(9)
train_control <- trainControl(method = "cv", number = 10)
Disease_model_lda <- train(Disease ~ ., data = Disease_training,
                            method = "lda", metric = "Accuracy",
                            trControl = train_control)

# We print a summary of what caret has done
print(Disease_model_lda)

# We then print the details of the model that has been created
print(Disease_model_lda$finalModel)

# STEP 4. Test the Model ----
# We can test the model
set.seed(9)
predictions <- predict(Disease_model_lda, newdata = Disease_testing)
confusionMatrix(predictions, Disease_testing$Disease)

# STEP 5. Save and Load your Model ----
# Saving a model into a file allows you to load it later and use it to make
# predictions. Saved models can be loaded by calling the `readRDS()` function

saveRDS(Disease_model_lda, "./models/Disease_model_lda.rds")
# The saved model can then be loaded later as follows:
loaded_Disease_model_lda <- readRDS("./models/Disease_model_lda.rds")
print(loaded_Disease_model_lda)

predictions_with_loaded_model <-
  predict(loaded_Disease_model_lda, newdata = Disease_testing)
confusionMatrix(predictions_with_loaded_model, Disease_testing$Disease)


# STEP 6. Creating Functions in R ----

# Plumber requires functions, an example of the syntax for creating a function
# in R is:

name_of_function <- function(arg) {
  # Do something with the argument called `arg`
}

# STEP 7. Make Predictions on New Data using the Saved Model ----
# We can also create and use our own data frame as follows:
to_be_predicted <-
  data.frame(pregnant = 6, glucose = 148, pressure = 72, triceps = 35,
             insulin = 0, mass = 33.6, pedigree = 0.627, age = 50)

# We then use the data frame to make predictions
predict(loaded_diabetes_model_lda, newdata = to_be_predicted)

# STEP 8. Make predictions using the model through a function ----
# An alternative is to create a function and then use the function to make
# predictions

predict_diabetes <-
  function(arg_pregnant, arg_glucose, arg_pressure, arg_triceps, arg_insulin,
           arg_mass, arg_pedigree, arg_age) {
    # Create a data frame using the arguments
    to_be_predicted <-
      data.frame(pregnant = arg_pregnant, glucose = arg_glucose,
                 pressure = arg_pressure, triceps = arg_triceps,
                 insulin = arg_insulin, mass = arg_mass,
                 pedigree = arg_pedigree, age = arg_age)

    # Make a prediction based on the data frame
    predict(loaded_diabetes_model_lda, to_be_predicted)
  }


# We can now call the function predict_diabetes() instead of calling the
# predict() function directly

predict_diabetes(6, 148, 72, 35, 0, 33.6, 0.627, 50)

predict_diabetes(1, 85, 66, 29, 0, 26.6, 0.351, 31)

# [OPTIONAL] **Deinitialization: Create a snapshot of the R environment ----
# Lastly, as a follow-up to the initialization step, record the packages
# installed and their sources in the lockfile so that other team-members can
# use renv::restore() to re-install the same package version in their local
# machine during their initialization step.
# renv::snapshot() # nolint
