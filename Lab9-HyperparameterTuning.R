# **[OPTIONAL] Initialization: Install and use renv ----
# The R Environment ("renv") package helps you create reproducible environments
# for your R projects. This is helpful when working in teams because it makes
# your R projects more isolated, portable and reproducible.

# Further reading:
#   Summary: https://rstudio.github.io/renv/
#   More detailed article: https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html

# "renv" It can be installed as follows:
# if (!is.element("renv", installed.packages()[, 1])) {
# install.packages("renv", dependencies = TRUE,
# repos = "https://cloud.r-project.org") # nolint
# }
# require("renv") # nolint

# Once installed, you can then use renv::init() to initialize renv in a new
# project.

# The prompt received after executing renv::init() is as shown below:
# This project already has a lockfile. What would you like to do?

# 1: Restore the project from the lockfile.
# 2: Discard the lockfile and re-initialize the project.
# 3: Activate the project without snapshotting or installing any packages.
# 4: Abort project initialization.

# Select option 1 to restore the project from the lockfile
# renv::init() # nolint

# This will set up a project library, containing all the packages you are
# currently using. The packages (and all the metadata needed to reinstall
# them) are recorded into a lockfile, renv.lock, and a .Rprofile ensures that
# the library is used every time you open the project.

# Consider a library as the location where packages are stored.
# Execute the following command to list all the libraries available in your
# computer:
.libPaths()

# One of the libraries should be a folder inside the project if you are using
# renv

# Then execute the following command to see which packages are available in
# each library:
lapply(.libPaths(), list.files)

# This can also be configured using the RStudio GUI when you click the project
# file, e.g., "BBT4206-R.Rproj" in the case of this project. Then
# navigate to the "Environments" tab and select "Use renv with this project".

# As you continue to work on your project, you can install and upgrade
# packages, using either:
# install.packages() and update.packages or
# renv::install() and renv::update()

# You can also clean up a project by removing unused packages using the
# following command: renv::clean()

# After you have confirmed that your code works as expected, use
# renv::snapshot(), AT THE END, to record the packages and their
# sources in the lockfile.

# Later, if you need to share your code with someone else or run your code on
# a new machine, your collaborator (or you) can call renv::restore() to
# reinstall the specific package versions recorded in the lockfile.

# [OPTIONAL]
# Execute the following code to reinstall the specific package versions
# recorded in the lockfile (restart R after executing the command):
# renv::restore() # nolint

# [OPTIONAL]
# If you get several errors setting up renv and you prefer not to use it, then
# you can deactivate it using the following command (restart R after executing
# the command):
# renv::deactivate() # nolint

# If renv::restore() did not install the "languageserver" package (required to
# use R for VS Code), then it can be installed manually as follows (restart R
# after executing the command):

if (require("languageserver")) {
  require("languageserver")
} else {
  install.packages("languageserver", dependencies = TRUE,
                   repos = "https://cloud.r-project.org")
}

# Introduction ----
# Hyperparameter tuning involves identifying and applying the best combination
# of algorithm parameters. Only the algorithm parameters that have a
# significant effect on the model's performance are available for tuning.

# STEP 1. Install and Load the Required Packages ----
## randomForest ----
if (require("randomForest")) {
  require("randomForest")
} else {
  install.packages("randomForest", dependencies = TRUE,
                   repos = "https://cloud.r-project.org")
}

## mlbench ----
if (require("mlbench")) {
  require("mlbench")
} else {
  install.packages("mlbench", dependencies = TRUE,
                   repos = "https://cloud.r-project.org")
}

## caret ----
if (require("caret")) {
  require("caret")
} else {
  install.packages("caret", dependencies = TRUE,
                   repos = "https://cloud.r-project.org")
}

## RRF ----
if (require("RRF")) {
  require("RRF")
} else {
  install.packages("RRF", dependencies = TRUE,
                   repos = "https://cloud.r-project.org")
}


# STEP 2. Load the Dataset ----
data(Sonar)
dataset <- Sonar
sonar_independent_variables <- dataset[, 1:60]
sonar_dependent_variables <- dataset[, 61]

# STEP 3. Train the Model ----
# The default random forest algorithm exposes the "mtry" parameter to be tuned.

## The "mtry" parameter ----
# Number of variables randomly sampled as candidates at each split.

# This can be confirmed from here:
#   https://topepo.github.io/caret/available-models.html
#   or by executing the following command: names(getModelInfo())

# We start by identifying the accuracy by using
# the recommended defaults for each parameter, i.e.,
# mtry=floor(sqrt(ncol(sonar_independent_variables))) or mtry=7

seed <- 7
metric <- "Accuracy"

train_control <- trainControl(method = "repeatedcv", number = 10, repeats = 3)
set.seed(seed)
mtry <- sqrt(ncol(sonar_independent_variables))
tunegrid <- expand.grid(.mtry = mtry)
sonar_model_default_rf <- train(Class ~ ., data = dataset, method = "rf",
                                metric = metric,
                                # enables us to maintain mtry at a constant
                                tuneGrid = tunegrid,
                                trControl = train_control)
print(sonar_model_default_rf)

# STEP 4. Apply a "Random Search" to identify the best parameter value ----
# A random search is good if we are unsure of what the value might be and
# we want to overcome any biases we may have for setting the parameter value
# (like the suggested "mtry" equation above).

train_control <- trainControl(method = "repeatedcv", number = 10, repeats = 3,
                              search = "random")
set.seed(seed)
mtry <- sqrt(ncol(sonar_independent_variables))

sonar_model_random_search_rf <- train(Class ~ ., data = dataset, method = "rf",
                                      metric = metric,
                                      # enables us to randomly search 12 options
                                      # for the value of mtry
                                      tuneLength = 12,
                                      trControl = train_control)

print(sonar_model_random_search_rf)
plot(sonar_model_random_search_rf)

# STEP 5. Apply a "Grid Search" to identify the best parameter value ----
# Each axis of the grid is an algorithm parameter, and points on the grid are
# specific combinations of parameters.

train_control <- trainControl(method = "repeatedcv", number = 10, repeats = 3,
                              search = "grid")
set.seed(seed)

getModelInfo("RRFglobal")

# The Regularized Random Forest algorithm exposes the "coefReg" parameter
# in addition to the "mtree" parameter for tuning.
## The "mtry" parameter ----
# Number of variables randomly sampled as candidates at each split.

## The "coefReg" parameter ----
# It stands for coefficient(s) of regularization.
# A smaller coefficient may lead to a smaller feature subset, i.e.,
# there are fewer variables with non-zero importance scores. coefReg must be
# either a single value (all variables have the same coefficient) or a numeric
# vector of length equal to the number of predictor variables. default: 0.8

tunegrid <- expand.grid(.mtry = c(1:10),
                        .coefReg = seq(from = 0.1, to = 1, by = 0.1))

sonar_model_grid_search_rrf_global <- train(Class ~ ., data = dataset, # nolint
                                            method = "RRFglobal",
                                            metric = metric,
                                            tuneGrid = tunegrid,
                                            trControl = train_control)
print(sonar_model_grid_search_rrf_global)
plot(sonar_model_grid_search_rrf_global)

# STEP 6. Apply a "Manual Search" to identify the best parameter value ----
# Manual Search
## The "mtry" parameter ----
# Number of variables randomly sampled as candidates at each split.

## The "ntree" parameter ----
# Number of trees to grow. It is limited by
# the amount of compute time available.

# We randomly search for a value for the mtry parameter but
# we manually search for a value for the ntree parameter.

train_control <- trainControl(method = "repeatedcv", number = 10,
                              repeats = 3, search = "random")

tunegrid <- expand.grid(.mtry = c(1:5))

modellist <- list()
for (ntree in c(500, 800, 1000)) {
  set.seed(seed)
  sonar_model_manual_search_rf <- train(Class ~ ., data = dataset,
                                        method = "rf", metric = metric,
                                        tuneGrid = tunegrid,
                                        trControl = train_control,
                                        ntree = ntree)
  key <- toString(ntree)
  modellist[[key]] <- sonar_model_manual_search_rf
}

# Lastly, we compare results to find which parameters gave the highest accuracy
print(modellist)

results <- resamples(modellist)
summary(results)
dotplot(results)

# [OPTIONAL] **Deinitialization: Create a snapshot of the R environment ----
# Lastly, as a follow-up to the initialization step, record the packages
# installed and their sources in the lockfile so that other team-members can
# use renv::restore() to re-install the same package version in their local
# machine during their initialization step.
# renv::snapshot() # nolint
